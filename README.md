# Columbia_Fintech_Challenge_13_Neural_Networks
## *Venture Funding with Deep Learning*

In this excercise, we are acting as a venture capital firm with the hopes to create a model that can evaluate funding applications from startups and predict whether they will be successful if funded by the venture capital firm. In this Jupyter Lab Notebook, we utilize our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks to evalulate and classify different funding applications on whether or not they will be successful.

The sections of this notebook are as follows: 

* Prepare the data for use on a neural network model. 
* Compile and evaluate binary classification model using a neural network.
* Optimize the neural network model.
